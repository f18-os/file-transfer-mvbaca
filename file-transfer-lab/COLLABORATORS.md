for this lab, I collaborated with Carlos Dominguez to figure out how a message
or file is transferred over a network. we figured out how to attach the size
of the message or file being sent to the message or file itself so the
server can know how big of a message or file it is receiving. Other
collaborators I used were stackOverFlow.com and youtube.com to better
understand how sockets can be implemented in python.
